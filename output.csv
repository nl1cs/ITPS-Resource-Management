"In 2007, computer scientist Luis von Ahn was working on converting printed books into a digital format. He found that some words were distorted enough that digital scanners couldn’t recognize them, but most humans could easily read them. 
Based on that finding, von Ahn invented a simple security test to keep automated “bots” out of websites. The first version of the reCAPTCHA test asked users to type one known word and one of the many words scanners couldn’t recognize. Correct answers proved the users were humans and added data to the book-digitizing project.

"The following text is from Edith Wharton’s 1905 novel The House of Mirth. Lily Bart and a companion are walking through a park. 
Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for the appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the fitting background of her own sensations. The landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches. On the nearer slopes the sugar-maples wavered like pyres of light; lower down was a massing of grey orchards, and here and there the lingering green of an oak-grove. 
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It creates a detailed image of the physical setting 
of the scene.","It establishes that a character is experiencing an 
internal conflict.","It makes an assertion that the next sentence then 
expands on.","It illustrates an idea that is introduced in the 
previous sentence"
