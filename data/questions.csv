An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides have the same length and all three angles have a measure of $60^{\circ}$. The height of the triangle, $k \sqrt{3}$, is the length of the altitude from one vertex. The altitude divides the equilateral triangle into two congruent $30-60-90$ right triangles, where the altitude is the side across from the $60^{\circ}$ angle in each $30-60-$ 90 right triangle. Since the altitude has a length of $k \sqrt{3}$, it follows from the properties of 30-60-90 right triangles that the side across from each $30^{\circ}$ angle has a length of $k$ and each hypotenuse has a length of $2 k$. In this case, the hypotenuse of each $30-60-90$ right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle; therefore, each side length of the equilateral triangle is $2 k$. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of each side. It's given that the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 624 ; therefore, $2 k+2 k+2 k=624$, or $6 k=624$.

Each equation in the given pair of equations can be written in slope-intercept form, $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane and $(0, b)$ is the $y$-intercept. For the first equation, $5 x+7 y=1$, subtracting $5 x$ from both sides gives $7 y=-5 x+1$, and dividing both sides of this equation by 7 gives $y=-\frac{5}{7} x+\frac{1}{7}$. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is $-\frac{5}{7}$. For the second equation, $a x+b y=1$, subtracting $a x$ from both sides gives $b y=-a x+1$, and dividing both sides of this equation by $b$ gives $y=-\frac{a}{b} x+\frac{1}{b}$. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is $-\frac{a}{b}$. Since the graph of the given pair of equations is a pair of perpendicular lines, the slope of the graph of the second equation, $-\frac{a}{b}$, must be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the graph of the first equation, $-\frac{5}{7}$. The negative reciprocal of $-\frac{5}{7}$ is $\frac{-1}{\left(-\frac{5}{7}\right)}$, or $\frac{7}{5}$. Therefore, $-\frac{a}{b}=\frac{7}{5}$, or $\frac{a}{b}=-\frac{7}{5}$. Similarly, rewriting the equations in choice B in slope-intercept form yields $y=-\frac{10}{7} x+\frac{1}{7}$ and $y=-\frac{a}{2 b} x+\frac{1}{2 b}$. It follows that the slope of the graph of the first equation in choice $B$ is $-\frac{10}{7}$ and the slope of the graph of the second equation in choice B is $-\frac{a}{2 b}$.

The researchers calculated that if individual plants were randomly distributed on this particular landscape, only about 15% would be with other plants in patches of vegetation. They counted the number of juvenile plants of five species growing in patches of vegetation and the number growing alone on bare ground and compared those numbers to what would be expected if the plants were randomly distributed.

Plant ecologists Anna Abrahão and Patricia de Britto Costa used microscopic analysis to determine that the roots of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha, which grow directly into the quartzite, have clusters of fine hairs near the root tip; further analysis indicated that these hairs secrete both malic and citric acids.

Most animals can regenerate some parts of their bodies, such as skin. But when a three-banded panther worm is cut into three pieces, each piece grows into a new worm. Researchers are investigating this feat partly to learn more about humans’ comparatively limited abilities to regenerate, and they’re making exciting progress. An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration.

Text 2
When Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement. However, as the team pointed out, the gene likely functions very differently in humans than it does in panther worms. Srivastava has likened EGR to a switch that activates other genes involved in regeneration in panther worms, but how this switch operates in humans remains unclear.

During the day, the Sun shines directly down on the atmosphere, so all wavelengths enter and the sky looks blue to a viewer. However, when the Sun gets lower on the horizon, the light is travelling through a much larger distance of the atmosphere to reach the same place on the Earth's surface. At that angle, many of the shorter blue waves get scattered into outer space, and only the longer, red waves, which travel in a straighter line before being scattered, reach the viewer.

Most animals can regenerate some parts of their bodies, such as skin. But when a three-banded panther worm is cut into three pieces, each piece grows into a new worm. Researchers are investigating this feat partly to learn more about humans’ comparatively limited abilities to regenerate, and they’re making exciting progress. An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration.

When Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement.

Anthony's recollections of the gallant Ulysses were vivid.

He was continually promising Anthony hunting trips and fishing trips and excursions to Atlantic City, ""oh, some time soon now;"" but none of them ever materialized. One trip they did take; when Anthony was eleven they went abroad, to England and Switzerland, and there in the best hotel in Lucerne his father died with much swearing and grunting and crying aloud for air.

65311b4715fbd084ee0c1541,"Text 1 
Ecologists have long wondered how thousands of microscopic phytoplankton species can live together near ocean surfaces competing for the same resources. According to conventional wisdom, one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain? Ecologists’ many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t uncovered a satisfactory explanation. 

Text 2 
Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton’s diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld’s team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.

Night wears a garment
All velvet soft, all violet blue...
And over her face she draws a veil
As shimmering fine as floating dew...
And here and there
In the black of her hair
The subtle hands of Night
Move slowly with their gem-starred light.

Dorian passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time.

653166bddcbce6b5cf46fc97,"Economists Kerwin Kofi Charles and Melvin Stephens Jr. investigated a variety of factors that influence voter turnout in the United States. Using survey data that revealed whether respondents voted in national elections and how knowledgeable respondents are about politics, Charles and Stephens claim that the likelihood of voting is driven in part by potential voters’ confidence in their assessments of candidates—essentially, the more informed voters are about politics, the more confident they are at evaluating whether candidates share their views, and thus the more likely they are to vote.
